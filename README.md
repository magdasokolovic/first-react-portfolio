### Animated Menu comments:
- good idea to disable menu button after clicking on it for ~1.2seconds and then enable it again (better user experience)
- z-indexes don't work unless you define a position
- in order for Header element to have an access to props.history we can use withRouter
***

### Hero Section comments: 
##### gsap: 
- in terms of easing use Power3
- TimelineLite allows to add the timeline to animations. (first come the photos, only then the text)
- 'to' - defines final state, 'from' defines initial state
- TweenMax is for animating just 1 item (in my case the whole hero section, with TweenMax we make the section visible)

***

### Things I learned while working on the project: 
- use ::selection CSS selector for customizing text highlight color
- use CSS ::placeholder Selector to give a styling to a placeholder text

> Add punctuation to your alt text:
   >> we should always finish our alt text with punctuation, such as a full stop/period. This makes the screen reader voice pause slightly before announcing the next words in the sequence, which feels a lot more natural. Example code:

```html
    <img src="puppy.jpg" alt="A golden retriever puppy wearing a tiny raincoat." />
```
